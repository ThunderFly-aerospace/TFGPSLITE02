# TFGPSLITE02 - Compact GNSS Module for Lightweight UAVs

The **TFGPSLITE02** module is a compact GNSS solution based on the [u-blox SAM-M8Q](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/sam-m8q-module). It is designed for small, lightweight, and simple UAVs, offering excellent positioning accuracy with support for multiple satellite constellations. It connects seamlessly to flight controllers via the [Pixhawk standard "Basic GPS Port"](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf).

## Connection to Flight Controller

The module interfaces with flight controllers using the Pixhawk standard **Basic GPS Port**. The port pinout is as follows:

| Pin | Signal    | Voltage |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1   | VCC       | +5V     |
| 2   | TX (OUT)  | +3.3V   |
| 3   | RX (IN)   | +3.3V   |
| 4   | I2C SCL   | +3.3V   |
| 5   | I2C SDA   | +3.3V   |
| 6   | GND       | GND     |


## Connection to payload

The module interfaces with the payload with the following signals:

| Pin | Signal    | Voltage |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1   | VCC       | +5V     |
| 2   | EXTINT (IN)  | +3.3V   |
| 3   | TPL (OUT)   | +3.3V   |
| 4   | GND       | GND     |
